## **Overview**

This project is an entry for the <b>Kaggle competition, "Blue Book for Bulldozers"</b>. The core objective is to predict the auction sale price of bulldozers using a comprehensive dataset of historical sales records and equipment specifications.

The solution implements an <b>end-to-end machine learning pipeline</b> encompassing:
* <b>Handling of time-series data</b>.
* <b>Robust data cleaning and preprocessing</b> utilizing <code>scikit-learn</code> Pipelines.
* In-depth <b>exploratory data analysis</b> with insightful visualizations.
* Training and evaluation of diverse <b>regression models</b>.
* Efficient <b>hyperparameter tuning</b> using <code>RandomizedSearchCV</code>.
* Persistence of the optimal trained model for seamless future use.

<br>

### **Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights**

- **Sale Price Distribution:** The `SalePrice` exhibits a significant <b>right skew</b>, indicating a higher frequency of lower-priced sales. - **Missing Data Handling:** Strategic imputation techniques were applied to address missing values across various features.
- **Time-Based Analysis:**
    - No strong linear correlation was observed between `SaleDate` and `SalePrice`, suggesting other features are more influential.     - Median `SalePrice` by `SaleMonth` analysis suggests potential <b>seasonal influences</b>.     - <b>State-by-State Analysis</b>: The median sale price varies significantly across different states, with some states having consistently higher or lower prices than the national median.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
To run this notebook, you will need the following libraries installed:
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `scikit-learn`
* `joblib`
* `pyarrow` (or `fastparquet`)

### **Installation**
You can install all necessary libraries using `pip`:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn joblib pyarrow

### **Usage**
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/brej-29/bulldozer-price-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd bulldozer-price-prediction`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
4. Run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis and model.

---

## **Modeling & Evaluation**
A <b>`scikit-learn` Pipeline</b> was constructed to seamlessly integrate data preprocessing with various regression models. Model performance was rigorously evaluated using key metrics such as <b>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</b> and the <b>R-squared (RÂ²) score</b>.

---

## **Model Deployment**
The final, fine-tuned model is persisted using `joblib`, enabling easy loading and utilization for future price predictions on new bulldozer data.
